# Exploring-eBay-Car-Sales-Data

# In this guided project, I worked with a dataset of used cars from eBay Kleinanzeigen, a classifieds section of the German eBay website.

# The dataset was originally scraped and uploaded to Kaggle by user orgesleka.
# The original dataset isn't available on Kaggle anymore.

# Some modifications were made from the original dataset:

# 50,000 were sampled data points from the full dataset, to ensure your code runs quickly in our hosted environment.
# The dataset was dirtied a bit to more closely resemble what would be expected from a scraped dataset (the version uploaded to Kaggle was cleaned to be easier to work with).
